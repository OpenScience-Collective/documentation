# About Us

## Who We Are

The Open Science Collective is a community-driven organization dedicated to building open-source tools for scientific research. We focus on serving small research communities with precise, reliable tools built for accuracy over scale.

## Our Focus

We develop tools that serve research communities working with:

- **HED** - Hierarchical Event Descriptors (annotation standard)
- **BIDS** - Brain Imaging Data Structure (data organization)
- **EEGLAB** - EEG analysis MATLAB toolbox

## Target Users

- Researchers learning HED annotations, BIDS formatting, or EEGLAB analysis
- Lab members needing quick, accurate answers from documentation
- Developers integrating these tools who need API/usage guidance

## Our Team

We are a diverse group of contributors including:

- **Researchers** who understand the challenges of modern neuroscience
- **Developers** who build robust, user-friendly tools
- **Domain experts** who ensure our tools meet real research needs
- **Community members** who provide feedback and support
