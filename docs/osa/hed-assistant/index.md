# HED Assistant

The HED Assistant is an AI-powered tool for working with Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED) in neuroscience research.

## Overview

HED (Hierarchical Event Descriptors) is a structured vocabulary and framework for annotating events in time-series data, particularly in neuroscience experiments. The HED Assistant makes it easier to:

- **Create** HED annotations with AI guidance
- **Validate** existing HED strings
- **Convert** between different annotation formats
- **Learn** HED through interactive examples

## Features

- :material-robot: **AI-Powered Suggestions** - Get intelligent recommendations for HED tags
- :material-check-circle: **Real-time Validation** - Instant feedback on annotation correctness
- :material-book-open-variant: **Schema Browser** - Explore the HED schema interactively
- :material-swap-horizontal: **Format Conversion** - Convert between HED formats seamlessly
