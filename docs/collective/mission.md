# Our Mission

## Vision

A world where scientific tools and knowledge are freely accessible to everyone.

## Mission Statement

The Open Science Collective exists to:

1. **Build** open-source tools that address real needs in scientific research
2. **Foster** a welcoming community of contributors and users
3. **Promote** best practices in open science and reproducible research
4. **Bridge** the gap between cutting-edge research and practical tools

## Design Principles

### Precision Over Features

Researchers need accurate, citation-backed answers. We prioritize reliability and correctness over feature count. Every response should be traceable to documentation or authoritative sources.

### Simple Infrastructure

Our tools are designed for lab server deployment without complex scaling requirements. Small research communities can self-host without DevOps expertise:

- No PostgreSQL, Redis, or Kubernetes required
- In-memory state for single-instance deployment
- Direct document fetching, no complex RAG pipelines

### Extensible Architecture

General tool systems that communities can adapt for their specific needs:

- Custom document retrieval tools
- Domain-specific validators
- Specialized system prompts
- Knowledge source retrievers

### Domain Expertise

Deep knowledge of specific tools (HED, BIDS, EEGLAB), not broad generalist approaches. Each assistant is tuned for its domain.

## Core Values

### Openness

Everything we create is open source. Our code, documentation, and discussions are all publicly available.

### Collaboration

We believe the best tools are built together. We welcome contributions from anyone, regardless of background or experience level.

### Quality

We strive for excellence in everything we do, from code quality to documentation to community interactions.

### No Mocks, Real Tests

We believe in testing with real data. No mock tests, no artificial passes. If a test doesn't use real data, it's not a real test.

## Goals

- Develop and maintain high-quality open-source tools for researchers
- Create comprehensive documentation that empowers users
- Build a sustainable community of contributors and maintainers
- Advance standards and best practices in open science
