# The Collective

Welcome to the Open Science Collective documentation. Here you'll find information about who we are, what we do, and how you can get involved.

## Overview

The Open Science Collective (OSC) is a community of researchers, developers, and enthusiasts working together to advance open science through collaborative software development. We build precise, reliable tools for small research communities.

## Our Projects

### Open Science Assistant (OSA)

An extensible AI assistant platform for researchers working with open science tools:

- **HED Assistant** - Hierarchical Event Descriptors, annotation standards
- **BIDS Assistant** - Brain Imaging Data Structure, dataset organization
- **EEGLAB Assistant** - EEG analysis, MATLAB toolbox guidance

Visit the [OSA section](../osa/index.md) to explore the platform.

## Design Philosophy

- **Precision over features**: Researchers need accurate, citation-backed answers
- **Simple infrastructure**: Lab server deployment, no complex scaling
- **Extensible tools**: General tool system that communities can adapt
- **Domain expertise**: Deep knowledge of specific tools, not broad generalist

## Join Us

We welcome contributors of all skill levels and backgrounds.
